Dogs vs. Cats Classifier

We wrote an algorithm to to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat.  
This is easy for humans, dogs, and cats. Computers will find it a bit more difficult.

State of the art results are achieved using very large Convolutional Neural networks. 
Model performance is reported in this classification accuracy table, with state-of-the-art results at 96.5% with human performance on the problem at 94%. 
In this demo, we will use a very basic CNN with suitable enhancements like image augmentation.

The data set
Asirra (Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting Access) is a HIP that works by asking users to identify photographs of cats and dogs. This task is difficult for computers, but studies have shown that people can accomplish it quickly and accurately. Many even think it's fun! Here is an example of the Asirra interface:

Asirra is unique because of its partnership with Petfinder.com, the world's largest site devoted to finding homes for homeless pets. They've provided Microsoft Research with over three million images of cats and dogs, manually classified by people at thousands of animal shelters across the United States. Kaggle is fortunate to offer a subset of this data for fun and research.
